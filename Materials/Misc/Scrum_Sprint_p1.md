## ðŸ”¹ What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is a **framework** used in Agile software development to manage and complete complex projects. Itâ€™s like a **set of rules or guidelines** for teams to work together effectively.

### âœ… Key Characteristics of Scrum:

* Lightweight and easy to understand
* Focuses on collaboration, accountability, and iterative progress
* Used not just in software, but also in product development, marketing, etc.

### âœ… Scrum is based on 3 pillars:

1. **Transparency** â€“ Everyone understands the work and goals.
2. **Inspection** â€“ Regular checks to see if everything is on track.
3. **Adaptation** â€“ Quickly adjust if things go off-track.

## ðŸ”¹ Scrum Roles (Whoâ€™s involved?)

1. **Product Owner** â€“ Represents the customer, prioritizes features, and manages the **Product Backlog**.
2. **Scrum Master** â€“ Ensures the team follows Scrum rules, removes obstacles.
3. **Development Team** â€“ People who build the product (developers, designers, testers, etc.).

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Sprint?

A **Sprint** is a **short, fixed-length period (usually 1 to 4 weeks)** in which the Scrum team works to complete a set of tasks or features from the Product Backlog.

Think of it like this:

* If Scrum is the **game**, then Sprints are the **rounds**.
* Every Sprint is like a mini-project with a clear goal.

### âœ… Key Characteristics of a Sprint:

* Has a **Sprint Goal**: a specific outcome or feature to deliver
* Always ends with a potentially **shippable product increment**
* Has consistent **duration** (e.g., every Sprint is always 2 weeks)

## ðŸ”„ Scrum Workflow (How Scrum and Sprint Fit Together)

Hereâ€™s how Scrum works using Sprints:

1. **Product Backlog** â€“ A big list of everything the product needs.
2. **Sprint Planning** â€“ The team picks items from the backlog to complete in the next Sprint.
3. **Sprint** â€“ Team works for 1-4 weeks.

   * Daily 15-minute **Scrum Meetings** (also called **Daily Stand-ups**)
4. **Sprint Review** â€“ End-of-sprint demo of what was done.
5. **Sprint Retrospective** â€“ Team reflects and improves for next Sprint.
6. **Repeat** â€“ Plan the next Sprint.

## ðŸ§  Real-Life Analogy:

Letâ€™s say you're building a **car**.

* **Scrum** is the **plan and teamwork structure** guiding how to build it.
* **Sprints** are like **milestones** â€” in Sprint 1, you build the chassis; in Sprint 2, the engine; in Sprint 3, the interior.

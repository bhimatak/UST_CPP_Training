### ‚úÖ Assumptions

* Team size: 2‚Äì3 members (e.g., 1 Developer, 1 Tester, 1 Scrum Master or Mentor)
* Time available: 8 working hours in a day (ideal for a hackathon sprint)
* Objective: Showcase a **functional EMS PoC** using:

  * C++ (with STL, OOP, multithreading)
  * Command-line interface
  * CRUD for employee records
  * Git + Jira integration for tracking

## ðŸš€ **Day 2: Operators and Expressions in C++**

---

### 1. Introduction to Operators

**Operators** in C++ are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. An **expression** is a combination of variables, constants, and operators that evaluates to a value.

> **Real-World Analogy:** Think of operators as tools â€“ like a calculator's `+`, `-`, `Ã—`, and `/` buttons â€“ letting you manipulate and compute values.

---

### 2. Types of Operators

| Type               | Example Operators         | Description                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Arithmetic         | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`   | Basic math operations                      |
| Relational          | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`     | Compare values, returns true/false         |
| Logical            | `&&`, `||`, `!`           | Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)          |
| Assignment         | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.     | Assign or update values                    |
| Increment/Decrement| `++`, `--`                | Increase/decrease value by 1               |
| Bitwise (advanced) | `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`  | Operate at binary level                    |

### 3. Examples and Syntax

#### Arithmetic Example:
```cpp
int a = 10, b = 3;
int sum = a + b;      // 13
int mod = a % b;      // 1
```

#### Relational Example:
```cpp
if (a > b) {
    cout << "a is greater";
}
```

#### Logical Example:
```cpp
if (a > 5 && b < 5) {
    cout << "Condition met";
}
```

### 4. Diagram: Operator Evaluation Order

> Operator precedence matters: `*` and `/` are evaluated before `+` and `-`, just like in math.

### 5. Real-World Use Case: Access Control

| Feature           | Operator Used | Logic                                       |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Age Verification | `>=`          | `if (age >= 18)`                            |
| Login Status     | `&&`, `==`    | `if (user == "admin" && isLoggedIn)`       |
| Input Validation | `!=`, `||`    | `if (input != "valid" || tries > 3)`       |

### 6. Best Practices

âœ… Use parentheses to clarify operator precedence  
âœ… Avoid deeply nested logical conditions  
âœ… Donâ€™t misuse assignment `=` as comparison `==`  
âœ… Keep expressions simple and readable

---

### 7. Hands-On Lab

**Task:**  
Create a program that takes two numbers and performs all arithmetic operations. Display the result of each.

**Bonus:** Add logic to compare the numbers and output which is larger or if they're equal.

---

### 8. Quiz

**Q1:** What is the output of `10 % 3`?  
> **A:** `1`

**Q2:** Which operator is used to compare equality?  
> **A:** `==`

**Q3:** True or False: `&&` returns true if both conditions are true  
> **A:** True

**Q4:** What does `a += 5` do if `a = 3`?  
> **A:** Sets `a = 8`

### 9. Daily Challenge / Mini Project

**Project:**  
Build a **Simple Calculator** that performs:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Takes user input for operation type and operands
- Includes validation for division by zero

**Bonus:** Use `switch` statements to cleanly handle operator choices

---

### 10. Summary

- Operators are used to manipulate data and control logic  
- Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators are the foundation of decision-making  
- Always watch out for operator precedence  
- Clean expressions = cleaner code and fewer bugs

---

### 11. Homework

- Extend the calculator project to include:
  - Square root, power, and modulus
  - Menu-driven interface
- Practice converting complex conditions into simple logic expressions

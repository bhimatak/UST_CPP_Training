## ðŸš€ **Day 9: Inheritance & Polymorphism in C++14/17 â€“ Powering Reusability and Dynamic Behavior**

---

### ðŸ”· 1. What is Inheritance?

Inheritance allows one class (**derived class**) to **reuse** and **extend** the features of another class (**base class**).

> ðŸ“Œ **Real-world analogy:** A `Car` is a type of `Vehicle`. All cars have wheels (from `Vehicle`), but each car can have its own model and brand.

---

### ðŸ”· 2. Types of Inheritance

| Type            | Syntax                        | Example                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Single**      | `class B : public A`          | `class Car : public Vehicle` |
| **Multilevel**  | `C â†’ B â†’ A`                   | `class SportsCar : public Car` |
| **Multiple**    | `class D : public B, public A`| Complex scenarios (handled carefully) |
| **Hierarchical**| Multiple classes from one base| `Truck`, `Bike` â†’ `Vehicle`  |

> ðŸš¨ Multiple inheritance should be used wisely to avoid the **Diamond Problem** (weâ€™ll cover that too!).

---

### ðŸ”· 3. Basic Syntax of Inheritance

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Vehicle started\n";
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() {
        cout << "Car honks\n";
    }
};
```

Usage:
```cpp
Car myCar;
myCar.start(); // from Vehicle
myCar.honk();  // from Car
```

### ðŸ”· 4. Access Specifiers in Inheritance

| Base Class Member | `public` Inheritance | `protected` Inheritance | `private` Inheritance |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `public`          | `public`             | `protected`              | `private`              |
| `protected`       | `protected`          | `protected`              | `private`              |
| `private`         | Not Inherited        | Not Inherited            | Not Inherited          |

---

### ðŸ”· 5. Real-World Example â€“ Employee Management

```cpp
class Employee {
protected:
    string name;
    int id;
public:
    Employee(string n, int i) : name(n), id(i) {}
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", ID: " << id << endl;
    }
};

class Manager : public Employee {
    int teamSize;
public:
    Manager(string n, int i, int t) : Employee(n, i), teamSize(t) {}
    void showTeam() {
        cout << name << " manages " << teamSize << " people.\n";
    }
};
```

Usage:
```cpp
Manager m("Alice", 101, 5);
m.display();   // From Employee
m.showTeam();  // From Manager
```

## ðŸŒ€ Polymorphism â€“ Same Interface, Different Behavior

---

### ðŸ”· 6. What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** means "many forms." In C++, this allows functions and methods to behave differently depending on the object or data theyâ€™re working on.

Two types:

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static)** â†’ *Function overloading, Operator overloading*  
2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic)** â†’ *Virtual functions*

---

### ðŸ”· 7. Compile-time Polymorphism: Function Overloading

```cpp
class Print {
public:
    void show(int a) { cout << "Int: " << a << endl; }
    void show(double d) { cout << "Double: " << d << endl; }
};
```

> ðŸ“Œ Functions with the **same name** but **different signatures**.

---

### ðŸ”· 8. Operator Overloading Example

```cpp
class Point {
    int x;
public:
    Point(int x) : x(x) {}
    Point operator+(const Point& p) {
        return Point(x + p.x);
    }
    void display() { cout << "Point: " << x << endl; }
};
```

---

### ðŸ”· 9. Run-time Polymorphism: Virtual Functions

Allows **dynamic dispatch** â€” the function that runs is determined at **runtime**, not compile time.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal sound\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Woof!\n";
    }
};
```

Usage:
```cpp
Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak(); // Outputs: Woof!
```

> Without `virtual`, it would have called `Animal::speak()`.

---

### ðŸ”· 10. Real-World Analogy: Payment System

```cpp
class Payment {
public:
    virtual void pay() {
        cout << "Generic payment\n";
    }
};

class CreditCard : public Payment {
public:
    void pay() override {
        cout << "Paid using Credit Card\n";
    }
};

class PayPal : public Payment {
public:
    void pay() override {
        cout << "Paid using PayPal\n";
    }
};

void processPayment(Payment* p) {
    p->pay();
}
```

Usage:
```cpp
Payment* p1 = new CreditCard();
Payment* p2 = new PayPal();
processPayment(p1);  // Credit Card
processPayment(p2);  // PayPal
```

---

### ðŸ”· 11. Virtual Destructors â€“ A Must-Have

If a base class has virtual functions, always provide a **virtual destructor** to ensure proper cleanup.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {
        cout << "Base destroyed\n";
    }
};
```

---

### ðŸ”· 12. Best Practices for Inheritance and Polymorphism

âœ… Use `override` to avoid surprises  
âœ… Always use `virtual` destructor in polymorphic base classes  
âœ… Use `final` if a class/function shouldn't be overridden (C++11+)  
âœ… Prefer composition over inheritance when unsure

---

### ðŸ”· 13. Hands-On Lab

- Create base class `Shape` with `draw()` as a virtual method  
- Derive `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` classes from `Shape`  
- Override `draw()` in each derived class  
- Create a function `render(Shape*)` that calls `draw()`

### ðŸ”· 15. Mini Project

**Project:**  
Build an **E-commerce Order System**:

- Base class `Order` with virtual method `calculateTotal()`
- Derived classes: `NormalOrder`, `BulkOrder`, `SubscriptionOrder`
- Override pricing logic in each
- Use polymorphism to process multiple orders in a loop

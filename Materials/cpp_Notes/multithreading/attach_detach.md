### 🔗 `join()`: Wait for Thread Completion

**Definition**:
Calling `join()` makes the main (or calling) thread wait until the spawned thread finishes execution.

#### ✅ Use `join()` when:

* You **need the result** or effect of the thread before continuing.
* You want **deterministic behavior**.
* You're working with **critical tasks** that must complete.

#### 🧠 Example: Logging System

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void logData() {
    std::cout << "Logging data..." << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    std::cout << "Log complete.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread logger(logData);
    logger.join(); // Main thread waits
    std::cout << "Main continues after logging.\n";
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
Logging data...
Log complete.
Main continues after logging.
```

### 🪂 `detach()`: Run Independently

**Definition**:
Calling `detach()` separates the thread from the main thread. The thread runs on its own — a *daemon thread*.

#### ✅ Use `detach()` when:

* You don't need to wait for the thread's completion.
* The thread is doing a **background** or **fire-and-forget** task.
* You want to **avoid blocking** the main thread.

#### ⚠️ Important: You must ensure that the detached thread does **not access local variables** that might go out of scope.

#### 🧠 Example: Background Analytics or Logging

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void backgroundTask() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));
    std::cout << "Background task done." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(backgroundTask);
    t.detach(); // Main won't wait
    std::cout << "Main is not blocked.\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5)); // Wait to see output
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```
Main is not blocked.
Background task done.
```

### ⚖️ Summary: `join()` vs `detach()`

| Feature     | `join()`                         | `detach()`                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ownership   | Maintained by main thread        | Released to the OS                |
| Waits?      | Yes                              | No                                |
| Use Case    | Dependent/critical tasks         | Background tasks                  |
| Safety      | Safe to use with local variables | Unsafe with local stack variables |
| Reusability | Cannot re-join once joined       | Cannot join after detach          |

## 🔄 Core Difference Summary

| Feature                | `shared_ptr`                              | `weak_ptr`                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ownership              | Yes (shared ownership)                    | No (non-owning observer)                  |
| Reference Count Impact | Increments reference count                | Does **not** increment reference count    |
| Keeps object alive?    | ✅ Yes, as long as one `shared_ptr` exists | ❌ No                                      |
| Access                 | Direct via `->`                           | Needs `.lock()` to get valid `shared_ptr` |
| Safe after deletion?   | Not needed; object lives                  | ✅ Safe (checks before access)             |

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Differences in Behavior

### 🧱 Step 1: Article Creation

| `shared_ptr` Code                                       | `weak_ptr` Code                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `shared_ptr<Article> P1 = make_shared<Article>("...");` | Same shared\_ptr created in both examples |

✅ In both, the `Publisher` (main) creates the `Article` using `make_shared`.

---

### 👥 Step 2: Subscribers Reference the Article

| `shared_ptr` Version                              | `weak_ptr` Version                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `shared_ptr<Article> P2 = P1;` (shared ownership) | `weak_ptr<Article> WP = P1;` (non-owning) |
| All `Subscriber`s hold a `shared_ptr`             | All `Subscriber`s hold a `weak_ptr`       |
| Reference count increases (P1 + P2 + P3 → 4)      | Reference count remains 1 (only `P1`)     |

✅ This is the **main behavioral difference** — `weak_ptr` **does not extend** the lifetime.

---

### 📖 Step 3: Subscribers Access the Article

| `shared_ptr` Code                    | `weak_ptr` Code                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Access via `P2->area()`              | Access via `if (auto sp = wp.lock())`            |
| Safe because ownership is guaranteed | Safe because `.lock()` checks if object is alive |

🧠 `weak_ptr` forces the programmer to check validity, which helps avoid crashes if the object has been deleted.

---

### 🗑 Step 4: Publisher Deletes the Article

| `shared_ptr` Code                                           | `weak_ptr` Code                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| After all `shared_ptr` go out of scope, object is deleted   | Only one `shared_ptr` (`P1`) existed, so `reset()` deletes the object immediately |
| All subscribers still have `shared_ptr` — keep object alive | `weak_ptr`s do **not** keep object alive                                          |

🔁 In the `weak_ptr` version, when the article is reset, it is **immediately destroyed**, even if subscribers exist.

---

### 🚫 Step 5: Subscribers Try to Access After Deletion

| `shared_ptr` Code                     | `weak_ptr` Code                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Still safe (shared\_ptrs still exist) | `lock()` returns `nullptr`; safe, but no access |
| Output: `Reading Article...`          | Output: `Article no longer available!`          |

✅ This is **safe behavior** in `weak_ptr`: you never dereference a dangling pointer.

---

## 📘 Analogy: Magazine Subscription

Imagine:

* The **Publisher** prints a magazine (`shared_ptr<Article>`)
* `shared_ptr` subscribers **own a copy** (magazine never vanishes as long as they hold it)
* `weak_ptr` subscribers **just borrow a reference** (if the magazine is gone, they can’t read it)

## 🔚 Final Thought

| Use `shared_ptr` When...                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| You want shared **ownership**                       |
| Object lifetime should extend as long as needed     |
| Example: multiple modules actively using a resource |

| Use `weak_ptr` When...                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| You want a **non-owning** observer                |
| Avoiding circular dependencies is important       |
| Example: cache, observer pattern, optional access |

Let's walk through a **real-world use case** of **pointers to class members** with a **step-by-step explanation**, using a **menu-driven command system** as an example.

## ‚úÖ Real-World Scenario: Dynamic Command Execution Using Member Function Pointers

### üîß Scenario:

You're building a **console menu system** where each menu option corresponds to a different function inside a class (e.g., banking operations like deposit, withdraw, check balance).

You want to:

* Dynamically map **menu choices to member functions**
* Avoid big `switch-case` or `if-else` chains
* Use **pointers to member functions** for clean and scalable code

---

## üí° Goal:

* `Bank` class has methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `checkBalance()`.
* You want a way to **map user input (1, 2, 3)** to call those member functions **using pointers to member functions**.

### üß± Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

// Step 1: Define a Bank class with multiple operations
class Bank {
private:
    int balance;

public:
    Bank() : balance(1000) {}

    void deposit() {
        cout << "Depositing ‚Çπ500...\n";
        balance += 500;
        cout << "Balance: ‚Çπ" << balance << endl;
    }

    void withdraw() {
        cout << "Withdrawing ‚Çπ300...\n";
        balance -= 300;
        cout << "Balance: ‚Çπ" << balance << endl;
    }

    void checkBalance() {
        cout << "Current Balance: ‚Çπ" << balance << endl;
    }
};
```

---

```cpp
int main() {
    Bank userAccount;

    // Step 2: Create a type alias for pointer to member function
    using Action = void (Bank::*)();

    // Step 3: Map menu choices to member function pointers
    map<int, Action> menu = {
        {1, &Bank::deposit},
        {2, &Bank::withdraw},
        {3, &Bank::checkBalance}
    };

    // Step 4: Menu loop
    int choice;
    do {
        cout << "\n--- Bank Menu ---\n";
        cout << "1. Deposit\n2. Withdraw\n3. Check Balance\n0. Exit\n";
        cout << "Enter choice: ";
        cin >> choice;

        if (menu.find(choice) != menu.end()) {
            // Step 5: Call the function using pointer to member
            Action action = menu[choice];
            (userAccount.*action)();  // call member function via pointer
        } else if (choice != 0) {
            cout << "Invalid choice. Try again.\n";
        }

    } while (choice != 0);

    cout << "Thanks for using our banking system!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### üîé Step-by-Step Breakdown

| Step | Concept                 | What‚Äôs Happening                                              |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Class Definition        | Create `Bank` class with member functions                     |
| 2    | Member Function Pointer | Define `Action` as type of member function with no parameters |
| 3    | Mapping                 | Use `std::map<int, Action>` to link user input to methods     |
| 4    | User Input              | Ask user to enter a menu choice                               |
| 5    | Invocation              | Call selected function using: `(object.*pointer)()`           |

### üß™ Sample Output:

```
--- Bank Menu ---
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
0. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Depositing ‚Çπ500...
Balance: ‚Çπ1500

Enter choice: 3
Current Balance: ‚Çπ1500
```

---

## üß† Why This Use Case is Important?

* **Scalability:** Add new functions by just adding to the map‚Äîno if-else chains.
* **Decoupling:** Keeps logic clean and separated.
* **Dynamic Execution:** You can even load this map from config files, etc.
* **Practical Uses:** Game menus, GUI callbacks, CLI tools, interpreters.

## üîÅ Bonus: What if You Have Parameters?

To use member functions with parameters, you'd need to wrap the call in a lambda:

```cpp
map<int, function<void()>> menu = {
    {1, [&]() { userAccount.deposit(500); }},
    {2, [&]() { userAccount.withdraw(200); }}
};
```

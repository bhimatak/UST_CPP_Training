Hashing is used in data structures primarily to speed up data retrieval and storage. It works by mapping data of any size to a fixed-size table index using a hash function, enabling quick access to elements based on their key. This makes operations like searching, insertion, and deletion highly efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Here's a more detailed look at why hashing is beneficial in data structures: 
1. Fast Data Retrieval: 

• Hashing allows for direct access to data elements using their hash values as indices in a hash table. [1, 7]  
• Instead of searching through the entire dataset sequentially (like in a linked list or array), you can quickly locate an element by calculating its hash and accessing the corresponding index. [1, 5, 8]  

2. Efficient Storage: 

• Hash tables store data in a way that minimizes collisions (where different keys map to the same index) and optimizes space utilization. [1, 9]  
• This leads to efficient use of memory and allows for quick lookups and storage of data. [6, 10]  

3. Key-Value Support: 

• Hashing is ideal for implementing key-value data structures, where each data element is associated with a unique key. [6]  
• The hash function maps the key to a specific index in the hash table, allowing for quick retrieval of the corresponding value. [5, 6]  

4. Data Integrity: 

• Hashing can be used to verify data integrity by generating a hash value for a piece of data (e.g., a file or message). 
• If the data is altered, the hash value will change, allowing you to detect any modifications. [11, 12]  

5. Security: 

• Hashing is used in security applications like password storage, where passwords are not stored in plain text but rather as their hash values. 
• This prevents unauthorized access to passwords, even if the database is compromised. [13, 14]  

6. Performance Optimization: 

• Hashing can significantly improve the performance of various operations like searching, sorting, and comparing data. [15]  
• By using hash tables, you can achieve close to constant-time complexity for these operations, making your programs faster and more efficient. [6, 15]  

In essence, hashing provides a powerful way to organize and access data efficiently, making it a crucial tool in various data structures and applications. [1, 3, 5]
